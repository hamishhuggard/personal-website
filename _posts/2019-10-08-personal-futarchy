Here are two things I'm interested in:
  * How to improve your decision making
  * How to aggregate communal knowledge

I've been thinking a bunch about how to combine these two threads. Is it possible to aggregate communal knowledge for personal decision making, like which goals to set, what career moves to make, and so on. 

Andreas Stuhlm√ºller is working on a similar idea with [Ought](https://ought.org/), which as I understand is an attempt to make a dialogue system in which one side of the conversation is outsourced to the internet and robots.
